# Hand Gesture Recognition – CNN Model

**SkillCraft Machine Learning Internship – Task 4**  
**Author:** Saimurthy Peteti  
**Domain:** Machine Learning

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize different hand gestures from images.  
It uses **image data augmentation** to improve model generalization and classifies gestures into multiple categories.  

---

## Features

- Recognizes multiple hand gesture classes  
- Uses **ImageDataGenerator** for real-time data augmentation  
- Builds and trains a CNN model with TensorFlow/Keras  
- Evaluates model performance with accuracy and loss plots  
- Saves the trained model for future use  

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding CNN architecture for image recognition  
- Applying image augmentation techniques for better performance  
- Training and validating deep learning models  
- Saving and reusing trained models for predictions

## Sample Usage
```bash
python Task4_HandGestureRecognition.py
